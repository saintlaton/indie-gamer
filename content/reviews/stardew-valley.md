**The hero** (in the beginning you can choose gender, name and appearance) - an office worker who inherited an abandoned farm. The landscape of the farm can also be selected. For example, you can decide whether there will be a river nearby for fishing.

**The farm area** needs to be cleared, and it will take time.
The hero has many different activities: plant and care for plants, raise livestock, practice crafts, extract ore, and also enter into relationships with residents of the neighbouring town to earn game money.

**Relationships with characters** include communication, performing tasks for money, exchanging, searching for fossils and even military actions and marrying.

The character is limited by the reserve of strength and health - both parameters are visible on the screen, and the game automatically puts the hero to rest if the limit of his capabilities is close.

**The game** does not set any ultimate or primary goal, its many possibilities are designed for an unlimited time.
